I prefer if you don't call since it will cost while I'm in Europe these coming weeks. You can text.

I'm an upcoming junior at CHS with an interest in computer science. I'm most comfortable in Swift but I also
have experience in Python and Keras. I tend to learn as I code. I'm very excited to be a part of this summer of code!

Availability:
I will be unavailable after Wednesday, July 10th at 4:00 PM this week.
On Monday the 15th and for the rest of the week, I will be available from 11 AM to 1 PM PST (8 PM - 10 PM Italy Time).
I will be unavailable again the following week until I return on the 26th.

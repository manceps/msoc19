My interest in computer science started at the beginning of my junior year when I took an intro to coding class. From there,
I wanted to learn more about coding and its importance in our world today. I am comfortable with Python than the other languages, 
but I am trying to learn other languages as well (especially Java script and HTML/CSS). I don't really have a whole lot of other 
experience in computer science, though I was able to exercise some knowledge for a coding club for girls. 
I will be an upcoming senior in Camas and will also be taking AP Computer Science to hopefully reveal my passion and a major 
in college. I also want to use this internship opportunity as my senior project because I think this will fuel my future! I am so
excited to be in a part of this opportunity with you all!

Availability:
I am pretty much available everyday right now, but weekends will be a little tough sometimes for me to reach. I available Mondays,
Wednesdays, and Fridays after 10 AM and Tuesdays and Thursdays after 1 PM (this will give me some time to prep for calls because I 
have swimming in the morning). On Wednesdays, sometimes I will be volunteering from 3-6:30 PM and I will let you all know if I'm 
busy that day because of that. July 18, 25, 26, 27 I have big swim competition meets to attend and I will let you know on time, too.
Since I have swim practices everyday, it's all in the morning so I will be free :) there are some afternoon practices too, but
I can definitely work around that.
Other than that, I'm open most of the time :) Thank You!

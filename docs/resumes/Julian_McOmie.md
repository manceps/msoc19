I started programming on a calculator and have loved it ever since. I'm an upcoming junior at Camas High School and plan to major in computer science in college. My programming knowledge is fairly broad due to my want to create all kinds of different projects ranging from programming a LiDAR scanner to making an operating system. I am excited to be working with cutting edge technology and participating in the summer of code.

Availability:
We are ending our Europe trip in Italy, so we are 9 hours ahead. I will be available from 8:00AM-2:00PM PST until July 15th. 

I am unavailable on the 14th-16th of July because we are traveling during the small window where Camas time and Italy time both work.

I am getting back from Europe on July 16th and will be available for most days all day. I have minor things like tennis a few times a week that can easily be worked around, but overall, I should be available most every day.
